MP 001 - Disassembler/Assembler
How to use:

1. Run jar file

2. A simple GUI that uses the JFilePicker class is provided to make choosing the file to convert easier.

3. The first text area will contain the pathname of the ASM file to be converted into a CPP file while 
the other text area will contain the pathname of the CPP file to be converted to an ASM file.

4. After clicking the "Convert to C++" and "Convert to Assembly" buttons, that will begin the conversion
of their respective file types.

5. Message pop-ups will appear whenever an error is encountered, such as when the file to convert was not 
opened succesfuly. A pop-up will also appear when the conversion is succesful.

6. When the conversion is succesful, you will find the produced file in the same directory as the jar file.

7. The file produced will have the same filename but with a different file type with the original file
(ex. "test.asm" will yield "test.cpp" after conversion, and vice-versa.)

8. Continuous conversion of a single file will not yield multiple copies of the produced file but rather will
overwrite the contents when the converted file already exists.
